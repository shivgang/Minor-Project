        <p>
          The ACM SIGCOMM 2023 conference seeks papers making significant
          research contributions to the field of data communication networks and
          networked systems. The conference takes a broad view of networking
          research. Please see the
          <a
            href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2023/cfp.html"
            class="ui-link"
            >Call for Papers</a
          >
          for a list of topics of particular relevance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Paper submissions typically report novel results firmly substantiated
          by experimentation, simulation, and/or analysis. As an aid to the
          community, the SIGCOMM website provides
          <a
            href="https://www.sigcomm.org/publish/hints-tips-and-guides/"
            class="ui-link"

          >
          to authors planning to submit to SIGCOMM conferences.
        </p>

        <p>
          To submit a paper to the SIGCOMM 2023 conference, please read the rest
          of this document regarding paper formatting, registration, anonymity,
          and other important issues relevant to your submission.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then use
          <a href="https://sigcomm2023.hotcrp.com/" class="ui-link"
            >the paper submission site</a
          >
          to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Register your abstract by
            <strong>Wednesday 8 Feb 2023, 23:59 UTC</strong>.
          </li>

          <li>
            Submit your paper by
            <strong>Wednesday 15 Feb 2023, 23:59 UTC</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        These are <strong> hard deadlines </strong> and no extensions will be
        given.

        <h2 id="paper-formatting">Paper Formatting</h2>

        <p>All submissions must obey the following formatting requirements.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Paper bodies (all content before references and appendices) must be
            no more than <strong>twelve (12) singleâspaced pages</strong>,
            including figures and tables, followed by as many pages as necessary
            for references and optional appendices. Papers whose pre-reference
            content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reviewers are not required to read any appendices or consider them
            in their review. Authors should thus ensure that the core paper is
            complete and self-contained. For example, if the appendix provides
            details of a proof or experiment, the body should summarize the key
            result.
          </li>
          <li>
            The paper body must include some statement about ethical
            considerations. This could be simply the sentence âThis work does
            not raise any ethical issuesâ, or where relevant (for example, but
            not exclusively, a paper involving human subjects), the discussion
            may be more detailed.
          </li>
          <li>
            If submitting to the experience-track, authors should indicate as
            such in the submission form and paper title.
          </li>
          <li>
            Papers must be formatted for printing on Letter-sized (8.5â by 11â)
            paper. Paper text blocks must follow ACM guidelines: double-column,
            with each column 9.25â by 3.33â, 0.33â space between columns. Each
            column must use 10-point font or larger, and contain no more than 55
            lines of text.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is your responsibility to ensure that your submission satisfies
            the above requirements. If you are using LaTeX, you may make use of
            <a href="https://github.com/scyue/ccp-sigcomm18" class="ui-link"
              >this template for ACM conference proceedings</a
            >. With the older versions of this template you must add â10ptâ to
            the documentclass command to meet the submission requirements. The
            current template sets 10pt by default. (Unlike the official
            template, it only includes an example for conference proceedings.)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Your goal as an author is to produce a clearly readable submission
          within the above constraints. Authors are strongly discouraged from
          violating the formatting requirements with the aim of including
          additional material:
          <strong

          After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the
          conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and
          can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly
          reject those papers with evident format violations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please make sure that your submitted paper satisfies the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            You must list the submission number and the number of pages
            (ideally) in your paper in the author block, e.g., âPaper #N, 12
            pages body, 14 pages totalâ, beneath your title. Registering your
            title, abstract, etc., will provide a paper submission number. Per
            the anonymity guidelines, you must remove any author names.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must provide an abstract, and it should be of no more than 200
            words.
          </li>
          <li>You must number the pages.</li>
          <li>
            You must submit papers in PDF (Portable Document Format) and ensure
            that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Other
            formats, including Postscript, will not be accepted. Avoid using
            non-standard fonts. The PC must be able to display and print your
            submission exactly as we receive it using only standard tools and
            printers, so we strongly suggest that you use only standard fonts
            that are embedded in the PDF file.
          </li>
          <li>
            You should ensure that the paper prints well on black-and-white
            printers, not color printers. Pay particular attention to figures
            and graphs in the paper to ensure that they are legible without
            color. Explicitly using grayscale colors will provide best control
            over how graphs and figures will print on black-and-white printers.
          </li>
          <li>
            You should ensure that labels and symbols used in graphs and figures
            are legible, including the font sizes of tick marks, axis labels,
            legends, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            You should limit the file size to less than 15 MB. Contact the PC
            chairs if you have a file larger than 15 MB.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="paper-registration">Paper Metadata and Conflicts</h2>

        <p>
          As part of the paper registration, authors will be required to provide
          paper metadata which includes title and abstract, author names,
          affiliations, contact email addresses, topics matching the subject
          matter of the paper, track (main or operational systems), and
          conflicts with program committee (PC) members.
        </p>

        <p>
          Broadly, we define conflict of interest with a PC member using the
          following principles:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            You are currently employed at the same institution, have been
            previously employed at the same institution within the last 12
            months, or are going to begin employment at the same institution.
          </li>
          <li>
            You have a professional partnership as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>Past or present association as thesis advisor or advisee.</li>
              <li>
                Collaboration on a project, publication, or grant proposal
                within the past 2 years (i.e., 2021 or later).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The PC chairs and members will review conflicts to ensure the
          integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts where necessary
          and sanity checking cases where conflicts do not appear justified. If
          there is no basis for PC conflicts provided by authors, those
          conflicts will be removed. Improperly identifying PC members as a
          conflict to avoid individual reviewers may lead to your paper being
          rejected. If you have concerns, please contact the PC chairs.
        </p>

        <h2 id="paper-anonymity">Paper Anonymity</h2>

        <p>
          All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and
          relevance through double-blind reviewing, where the identities of the
          authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are
          required to make a good-faith effort to preserve the anonymity of your
          submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully grasp
          the context of related past work, including your own. Common sense and
          careful writing will go a long way towards preserving anonymity.
          Minimally, please take the following steps when preparing your
          submission:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Remove the names and affiliations of authors from the title page.
            For experience-track papers, it is OK (but not necessary) to reveal
            company or system names but NOT author names; this applies to both
            the title block and the main body of the paper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use care in naming your files. Source file names (e.g.,
            âJohn-Doe.dviâ) are often embedded in the final output as readily
            accessible comments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not
            omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer
            unable to grasp the context. Instead, reference your past work in
            the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work
            by another author.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not embed pointers to external sources (e.g., public GitHub
            repositories) that leak author identity or affiliation.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In addition to submitting an anonymized paper, double-blind reviewing
          requires that both authors and reviewers take care while reviewing is
          happening.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Authors are welcome to release their paper in a non-peer-reviewed
            location (such as a technical report by your institution or arXiv),
            but you should not broadcast information about the publication
            widely. For example, do not post it to large mailing lists or social
            media forums where PC members would easily encounter it, and do not
            do general press releases. Authors are also welcome to talk about
            their work (as work-in-progress) at local institutions. In either
            case, authors should be aware of PC members who might encounter the
            work and avoid sharing the work in a way that a PC member would
            encounter it.
          </li>
          <li>
            PC members and other reviewers are expected to not actively attempt
            to deanonymize papers. In either case, if there is a breach of
            double-blind reviewing, the author and the reviewer should report it
            to the PC chairs.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="ethics-considerations">Ethics Considerations</h2>

        <p>
          All papers must include, in the main body of the paper, a statement
          about ethical issues;
          <strong
            >papers that donât include such a statement may be rejected</strong
          >. This could be, if appropriate for the paper, simply the sentence
          âThis work does not raise any ethical issues.â If the work involves
          human subjects or potentially sensitive data (e.g., user traffic or
          social network information, evaluation of censorship, etc.), the paper
          should clearly discuss these issues, perhaps in a separate subsection.
        </p>

        <p>
          Papers must follow basic precepts of ethical research and subscribe to
          community norms. These include respect for privacy, secure storage of
          sensitive data, voluntary and informed consent if human subjects are
          involved or other people are placed at risk, avoiding deceptive
          practices when not essential, beneficence (maximizing the benefits to
          an individual or to society while minimizing potential harm to an
          individual), and risk mitigation. Authors may want to consult the
          <a

        </p>

        <p>
          Many organizations have an ethics review process (sometimes called an
          Institutional Review Board, IRB). In some cases, research work may
          clearly have no human subjects, and formal institutional review may
          not be required. (However, a sentence in the paper stating this
          evaluation is still required.) In many cases, IRB involvement is
          appropriate. IRB approval of research is an important factor (and
          should be mentioned), but the program committee will independently
          evaluate the ethical soundness of the work just as they evaluate its
          technical soundness.
        </p>

        <p>
          The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and
          the PC chairs may reach out to authors during the review process if
          questions arise.
        </p>

        <h2 id="paper-novelty">Paper Novelty</h2>

        <p>
          Under no circumstances, except where noted below, should authors
          submit previously-published work, submit the same work simultaneously
          to multiple venues, or submit papers that plagiarize the work of other
          authors. Like other conferences and journals, SIGCOMM prohibits these
          practices and may take action against authors who have engaged in
          them. In some cases, the program committee may share information about
          submitted papers with other conference chairs and journal editors to
          ensure the integrity of papers under consideration. If the PC
          discovers a violation of these principles, sanctions may include, but
          are not limited to, contacting the institutions of the authors and
          publicizing the details of the case.
        </p>

        <p>
          Work that extends an author's previous workshop paper is welcome, but
          in their submitted SIGCOMM paper the author(s) should (a) acknowledge
          their own previous workshop publication with an anonymous citation
          (e.g., "[7] Anonymized workshop paper") and (b) explain the
          differences between the SIGCOMM submission and the prior workshop
          paper. In addition, the online submission form will require authors to
          submit the deanonymized citation and a short explanation of the
          differences from the prior workshop paper. The SIGCOMM PC will review
          such extended versions of previously-published workshop papers in
          accordance with the

        <h2 id="paper-acceptance">Paper Acceptance</h2>

        <p>
          The SIGCOMM 2023 PC will notify authors of acceptance/rejection
          decisions by May 20, 2023. All accepted papers will be shepherded by
          members of the PC. Authors of accepted papers should plan to interact
          with their shepherds immediately after notification, and to budget
          sufficient time between acceptance notification and the camera-ready
          deadline to coordinate with their shepherd. It is a requirement that
          the paper be considered acceptable to the assigned shepherd so that
          the updates to the paper reflect the issues raised by the PC
          (conflicts will be mediated by the PC chairs) before the paper is
          considered âacceptedâ to appear in the conference proceedings. In
          addition, the publisher of the SIGCOMM proceedings will review all
          accepted papers submitted for the camera-ready deadline. Authors
          should also budget sufficient time immediately after the camera-ready
          deadline to be available and responsive to any editing changes
          requested by the publisher.
        </p>

        <p>
          After acceptance, substantive changes to paper titles require approval
          by the PC chairs. Only in exceptional circumstances should authors
          change their author list, and only with the approval of the PC chairs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Authors of accepted papers will also need to sign an ACM
          copyright-release form. All rejected papers will be treated as
          permanently confidential.
        </p>
